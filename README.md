Application that will use opencv(python), and tensorflow to create an application for security services that can track cars accurately without the purchasing of sensors. 
This application uses tensorflow and opencv to allow a user to select and view cars currently in a parking lot. The information screen can also show to a great accuracy if a car exists in the parking spot the user selected. 


The project was created under the review of the ONU Public Safety Department. 

Special Thanks to Dr. Youssfi for his knowledge in machine learning.

Other members of this team included: 	Miranda Huddle, Hayden Shenefield, and Bryce Gray.
